In this project, I am using a car dataset with 8128 rows and 13 columns. My main intention is to use different tree-based classification models and see which one predicts the price category variables the best. I will also be using different hyperparameters across all the models to see the effect of hyperparameters on model performance. Here is the process in detail:

*	Preprocessed car dataset by cleaning, transforming data, and creating dummy variables for categorical features.
*	Conducted 70-30 train-test split and evaluated Decision Tree classifier's performance using GINI and Entropy criteria.
*	Created visualization of the Decision Tree classifier to understand its decision-making process.
*	Built Random Forest classifier using best-performing criterion and evaluated performance with accuracy scores.
